    // NOTES:
    // - measures time and space complexities of algorithms
    // - time complexity -> number of operations per input
    // - space complexity -> number of variables in memory per input
    // O(n) is visiting every single one of the elements
    // the o in big o stands for order of magnitude
    // we avoid algorithms that have very large complexities
    // sometimes to improve the time complexity we might need to create an auxiliary data structure
    //  this means that to achieve a better time complexity for an algorithm, you might need to use
    //  an additional data structure, which could help optimize the operations and reduce the overal
    //  time complexity
